title: I'm an intern and Merry Christmas!

### Finally relieved
After months of struggle, I managed to land an internship. Those who read my
previous blogposts and those who know me are aware of how many hardships I
went through to even get a single interview! This was really a difficult task,
but I finally managed to set a foot in the Cybersecurity market. Besides, even
though the domain I'm specializing in is very new to me and quite a complex
one, it is so interesting and very stimulating! So I'm twice as happy!

Although I'm still a newbie, I somehow managed to get the hang of it pretty
quickly imo. Despite the fact that I should definitely relax and do something
else outside of work hours, I still work overtime to practice and learn more
and more. It is just this interesting to me that I want to keep getting better!

Next objective for me is of course to keep grinding, and try to land that job.
Hopefully, I will be able to do it if I keep this pace!

Here is a playlist I made for the occasion!

### Finally holidays
Of course, I will finally take some time for myself to relax a little bit.
And I got to say, the feeling of not having to move heaven and earth anymore to
try to find an internship is priceless. 

Also it's Christmas! It's not the period of the year that I prefer, but it's
still quite nice to have the pretty lights outside, the celebrations, the
gatherings with your loved ones. And I don't want to sound like a moralist, but
I do think that we need to learn to enjoy and cherish more these nice moments.
Other people are not as lucky as us, and we need to be more aware of this. It's
a freedom that we need to protect and cannot take for granted.

Here is a second playlist for the price of a single blogpost!

### Conclusion
This was a very short blogpost, hopefully I will have more stuff I can speak
about!

I hope this year has been a kind to you guys, and I wish that the next one will
be even better! I would like to conclude this post by a quote I like (I forgot
the name of the author tho).

>Life is already very tough by itself, so try to make it easier to everyone by
>being nice to the others, including yourself!

See you space cowboy...
